# python_ftp_scheduler_gui
Some old Python code for fuge.it seedbox. py2exe used to generate binary executables for windows from python source code. Code is a mess, not really sure what it was used for anymore tbh, but keeping around in case I ever want to build a gui app using python and/or create windows binaries from python code.
